## Introduction

This peer assessed assignment provides a simple Shiny application, deployed to Rstudio's servers, as well as a reproducuble pitch created with Slidify.

## Part 1 Shiny Application

The application allows the user to enter an input phrase, the next word is predicted by the app.

Profanity filtering can be switched on or off by selecting the checkbox.  When switched on, a predefined list of words will not be included as predictions, but will be replaced with a string indicating profanity.

The application is hosted on shinyapps.io at:
